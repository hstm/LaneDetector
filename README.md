# LaneDetector
Simple Lane Detector for iOS based on OpenCV

This is an adapted version of the SimpleLaneDetector by Anurag Ajwani (https://github.com/anuragajwani).

Execute install-opencv.sh in the project's root to install the OpenCV framework for iOS v3.4.6.

If you want to use your own OpenCV framework for iOS build, please make sure you compiled it with C++-11 support enabled.
